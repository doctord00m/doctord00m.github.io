Hey, I am Arushik, a student interested in all things technology, philosophy and cognitive science specifically on the theory of learning.

I am well-versed in statistical modelling, embedded systems and all things concerning engineering. Let's connect.

I try not to hide my identity completely, you can easily figure out who I am through the below links.

I choose to keep atleast one level of abstraction however so that the ordinary paserby that doesn't look beyond can just remember me as another stranger on the internet.
