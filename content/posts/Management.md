# Ah, yes, Management.

The epitome of corporate circle-jerking and unnecessary corporate bureaucracy, nevertheless the most important part of any corporate structure or enterprise. And as a result of it's significance, it taught in some form or sense in university.

I just finished my Mid-Semester examination for the course - "Essentials of Management". It was alright, except for one question that completely threw me on a curveball.

![alt text](https://static.studyusa.com/blog/COLOR-THROW-A-CURVE-StudyUSA.jpg?format=webp)

The question, as far as I can recall goes something like this:

> Mr. X was involved in an organization that manufactures food products, he has a degree in the food manufacturing process and was dissatisfied in his current capcity. So he quit and established a new manufacturing unit for the same. He sets Mr. Y to set up the entire process and production system. Mr. X plans to handle the marketting part through his private outlets. Mr. Y also has to bring in certain sales expectations to Mr. X by the end of the quarter. The raw materials will be sourced by the organic farmers in a line of credit and will fund the first three months of the business. Mr. Y also plans to punish and penalise employees who don't wear gloves during the production process. 
Identify the 4 types of plans that will be employed during this process.

Seems easy enough, right? But I was completely wrong with my thought process and this is the core problem behind Management problems presented to you in examinations, atleas in India, where I am from.

The question asked for a list of plans that will be employed during the production process. The first thing that came to mind was a cost-benefit analysis. But then I thought that there might be some other kind of plan that would be more appropriate, so I started thinking about things like:
- Financial Planning
- Sales Planning
- Strategy Planning

So I figured that the question was looking for a list of plans, and I wrote down the 4 plans which I thought were applicable, after all they are asking the *types of plans* 

This was my first and most detrimental mistake.

One look at my study material and you will find that apparently the types of plans are in fact:
- Mission
- Vision
- Strategy
- Goals
- Objectives

This is the type of absolute bullshit pulled by management, the lingo used doesn't make sense whatsoever but oh well. It's incredible how they are using the words "plan" and "strategy" interchangeably. If the question was rather about *strategy* or *drawing out / sketching out a strategic plan* I would have written about what they required.

Anyways, I should stop the rant. I'm going to start preparing for my cryptography test tomorrow, it's fairly technical and I'm pretty sure they won't drop in any tongue twisters like this test did.
