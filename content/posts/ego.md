# Ego is the enemy

Based on the title of Ryan Holiday on his musings of the Stoics. A title that is so befitting this particular musing of mine also.

I had to pause and write this (I was studying and immediately this popped into my head) because, whenever I need to retroactively reflect upon and recollect my trinkets of ideas, I can simply look at this repository. 

Anyways, here's the main idea.

> You don't know everything, therefore you must not be ignorant of anything.

There you go, that's the biggest idea I want to convey but the reasoning behind this will be explained before.

Basically, while I was studying, I found myself just going - *"Ah! I don't need to read that, I'll just skim through and everything will be gucci!"*

**No. You don't, fucking read it.**

It's like a form of laziness, and as such should be eliminated. Never ever over-estimate your ability to read and comprehend information just because you scanned a couple of words and went - *"Ah Seems easy enough"*. You're gonna get **fucked** as a result. Treat everything as it is, by itself. Each, it's own self-contained unit that has relevance, may not be to the *greatest* extent, but it matters and you won't recognize it immediately.

I guess this is also a problem due to the fact that I am preparing for an exam 2 days before it starts, and therefore my brain is doing this not out of laziness but out of panic which is even fucking worse.

As I used this image in the previous article, I will use it again.

It's a painful process, admittedly. I struggle to do this, one way to **super-charge** your learning is to use ChatGPT / Gemini to basically hack the thinking process in your brain which you might try to shut off because you're scared that you're:
1. Wasting time
2. Wasting energy
3. Wasting space for more higher yield information
when in fact these particular problems can be addressed by having better thought out previously what / which information you have to learn and address. If you haven't please spend some time just sifting through the information so that you may better tap into:

## The flow state, kinda.

It's not a real flow state but rather a bouncing oscillating feeling of anxiety and boredom. It's more pseudo-flow rather than **true flow** that you achieve because if you don't have a passable notion of the information you're studying then you'll end up either getting bored due to lack of interest or stressed due to lack of depth.

This method, which involves you having **pre-sifted** through information you want to learn *thoroughly* will allows you to simple achieve a gradient regional flow where-in:

This is more of a hack rather than a proper solution, but atleast you'll get somewhere with this.
