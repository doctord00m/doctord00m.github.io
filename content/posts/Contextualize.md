# Context is king.

The essence of learning anything new comes to *context*. Context is king.
Contextualizing a subject is the way you can relate the subject or information presented to you as a method of learning it deeply.  
  
If you wanted to convert any highly boring and theoretical information into that which is easier for you to understand and process, and retain it over a long period of time, then the idea is to put it into different contexts.  

This results in a higher yield where I quantify yield:
{.poetry}
1. Quality of connections in the brain
2. Quantity of connections in the brain
3. Retention of information
4. Application of information under various contexts

Quality of connections as a metric

In the above picture, I mean to showcase that the higher and deeper quality of questioning you ask to the information, the better you can learn that information.
I mean to discuss how higher quality reasoning results in better retention of the information. It's fundamentally tied to a process known as **Deep Processing.**

Its the inhernet cognitive ability to comprehend any information presented from a higher order rather than lower order level of thinking. Let me explain.
The principle is that, if instead of looking at a piece of information and going - *"I don't understand what they are saying, let me read it again."* or "*I don't understand
what they are saying, let me just memorize it."*

You instead practice deep processing which are as follows:
{.poetry}
1. What are the first principles of the information provided (you need not understand this)
2. How is this information relevant to my current context?
    - The problem I am trying to solve
    - The theory I am trying to understand
    - The idea I am trying to formulate
    - The analysis I am trying to evaluate
3. Can I apply this information to a different scenario or can I encounter this information being used in different ways
in the same scenraio.
    - This could be using a math formula to sovle 4 different classifications of the same nature of problems (applying the basic integral patterns by inducing it i.e. multiplying and dividing by some component to force the pattern to occur).
    - Or, it could be applying a physics concept to 4 different concepts altogether (applying conservation of energy in momentum problems).

If you are unable to relate, the **induce**. Create a hypothetical scenario where this information could become useful in the future.
This technique is really effective at captivating your underlying cognitive processes to make the information more **relevant** and **contextualized**.

Quantity of connections as a metric.

So the image basically describes that the number of connections you make is really equivalently dependent on the quality of questions you're asking. Lower quality questions don't yield more information, but the highest quality of questioning yields a very high number of connections.

It's fairly simplistic, you learn more from asking deeper questions!

Retention of Information as a metric.

The image describes the parallels between the [Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) and the **Contextualized Recall** curve.
There's no such thing as contextualized recall, its a term I am coining used to describe how
infomration accquisition through [Interleaved Retrieval and Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10509) with [Contextualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_learning) is a better methodology to increase information retention.

The Y-Axis describes recall which, in this context, I refer to the amount of information that actually does exist in your brain and can be recalled.
The graph suggests that over time, the number of connections slowly deteriorates, and this is true, we can apply the simple logic of *Use it or Lose it.*

But ultimately, information learnt like that is information learnt in **isolation** and **decontextualized**. This is dangerous because you end up forming isolated chunks of memory that only fire in a very specific scenario, such as a sequence of operations you do to solve a problem like following a recipe. Most people forget recipes which is why recipebooks exists.

But the best chefs reason from first principles, they don't need cookbooks or recipebooks, they understand how flavours blend together, how to alter the flavour to different pallates.
An example is how most of North Indian cooking uses a very basic Tomato, Onion, Garlic paste as a base, and then they alter the spices, min-max it and bring together different gravies.

{.poetry}
> The best chefs understand how certain principles (by principles I mean ingredients, components of a meal, spice levels, bases / sauces) interact in different contexts, and that's what seperates a homecook from a chef.

Rajma, Chole, Aloo Matar, Dal Makhani, Paneer Butter Masala all use the same base. But I haven't listed all because, well, I can't, it's too big.

So, understand the underlying patterns and don't focus too much on the details, develop a **schema** of how the context works, and you can work from there onwards.
What do I mean by schema? In knowledge theory, schema is best described in this [video](https://youtu.be/hz4JKqoG_Mc?si=vup7oUI6vbMMV42P) by Dr. Justin Sung.

Transfer of Knowledge as a metric.

We have come to the final section of this article. **Knowledge Transfer**.
Knoweldge Transfer is that part of cognitive psychology that has been researched pretty poorly. Knowledge Transfer is the inherent ability to take information and apply it in different contexts, which is the heart of what this entire article aims to talk about.

Traditional eductaion **sucks** at Knowledge Transfer.
It's pretty obvious why though.

Traditional education focuses on "teaching" you:
{.poetry}
> A very dumb and passive way of remembering and regurgitating a specific sequence of steps for a problem or test that is timed, therefore your priority isn't how well you've learned the information, rather how quickly can you apply it to solve a problem. This is a disaster.

The core of problem-solving is patter recognition, sure, but the patterns emerge through some level of deep processing. School mostly trains you to memorize the patterns (here patterns also refer to the sequence of steps and operatinos to do to solve a problem) and well, apply them. This is observable to a great extent in competitive exams like the [Gaokao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaokao) and [JEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Entrance_Examination). 

Well sure, your students end up learning a massive repository of patterns and problem solving strategies. But given a novel problem, has your education prepared you to solve it?

The immediate response to a novel problem is, is there an existing solution for this or not? If so, just look at how that's been decomposed, memorize the pattern, apply it to a 1000 problems and move on. Well then, what have you achieved? 
This is **literally** rote memorization. You did not do any attempt in:
{.potry}
1. Problem Decomposition
2. Apply patterns to existing sub-problems.
3. Hypothesize a solution to new sub-problems.
4. Incrementally test your solution, if it fails try something new.
5. Learn from your results and adapt your solution.
6. Create [deductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning) and [inductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning) reasoning.
7. Understand the constraints of the problem, thereby learning which contexts this solution can be applicable to.

This is what education fails to do, and I mean, I can't really blame it. In today's world, teaching this is far far more difficult for teachers and professors than it is to solve 200 problems in a particular topic and moving on.

But, there's a point in a Scientist's, Engineer's, Doctor's life where they realise that this education did not teach them **how to think**.

Here's what you do, if you're prepraing for an exam, with the way the system is set up, it rewards rote-learning and regurgitation. So forget the exams, just memorize the patterns and move on.

But if you're learning for yourself, then **teach yourself** to take the information given to you and **apply it in different contexts**, **examine the constraints** of the context and the information, figure out why it works here and not somewhere else.

The ability to understand how to arrive at a solution given a novel problem, and apply that solution to different contexts whether it be in STEM or Non-STEM disciplines is the heart of contextualization.
