This is a continuation of my series of posts on Failure. I believe I haven't covered an interesting aspect of failure which is the *psychological* aspect of failing. So here's my personal experience with the psychological, not the cognitive manifestations.

My typical learning process, before I started experimenting with myself could be broken down like so:

{{<img src="/posts/image-16.png" alt="learn-cycle" class="center" width="75%" height="75%">}}

So the problem with this is that, well, I learn **fuck all** doing this. And the reasoning I had is kinda surprising, and I am sharing hoping you all could relate to it.

It was essentially a form of self-torture.

My logic was: If I didn't get the answer to a problem / question within the first try, I haven't understood it well enough. Therefore I can never understand well enough, and I won't refer to the solution to try to learn why I was wrong, rather I'll learn the theory again until I can answer this very question. This is very retrogradive fucky wucky reasoning.

Can you see how shitty it can get, on the one hand, there's a *linear **growth** progression*.
On the other hand, there's a cyclical, non-stop horrendous rabbit hole of despair and just plain pathetic downtrodden gobshite.

The genesis of this tumultuous system of learning was birthed from a internalized **fear of failure**. I fucking hated failing. Even when the cost of failing was nothing but some time, I valued success so much that even failing at the cost of nothing but time and a little energy, which in the grand scheme of things is NOTHING substantial, that I internally found ways to just avoid failure by, well, avoiding things that can cause me failure.

For most people, this would be skipping tests, not hitting the gym often, not studying. For me, as I see it, it's far worse, my brain pre-calculated like a fucking chess grand-master that:
{.poetry}
> 1. Hitting the gym? Can't lift 40 kg dumbbells? You FAILED. Give up.
> 2. Studying? Can't solve a problem? You FAILED. Don't solve problems.
> 3. Learning for the heck of it? Can't execute some step? You FAILED. Don't ever try doing this again.

Can you see how this can lead to an **internalized system of Confirmation Bias**?

For those who don't know, **[Confirmation Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)** is basically a psychological concept discussing how we tend to look for explanations that support our initial presumptions, pre-dispositions. But in more fundamental terms - It's probably looking for any proofs that support your concept disregarding any **[counterexamples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterexample#:~:text=A%20counterexample%20is%20any%20exception,fields%20of%20mathematics%20and%20philosophy.)**, **[singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(mathematics))**, **[counterfactuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactual_conditional)** or **irregularities**.

I conditioned myself to think like this, and when any test was presented to well, test my knowledge, I'd fucking fail because I just **refused** to question myself because it's uncomfortable (as a result of an internal conditioning mechanism stemmed from the fear of failure) and scary.

So the way you fix this, is to reframe failure, not as a weakness, but as one of the greatest **strengths** that you can possess. Because experts in any field are experts not because their just geniuses (it's like 30% the reason behind it, by my shitty estimate) but rather their attitude to failure, growth, conditioning, mindset, willpower.

I got my GPA up from a crappy **7.62** to a whoppin **8.72** (results just released today morning, Yay!) by the end of 5th semester.   

Remember, to be a **perfectionist** you must learn to **avoid failure** which means **you should fail** so that **you don't make the same mistake twice**.

So one of the main things to do is to **actively seek failure as early as you can**. Whether you are:
1. Studying for an exam
2. Hitting the gym
3. Asking a girl out
4. idk anymore examples but yeah..

and then don't forget this step - **seek answers from your failures**. It's a correcting mechanism.

I guess I should write a small book kinda thing within this website. I'll think about it.

Anyways, I am struggling to do a hackathon atm, not my fault tho, teammates need to pick up their weight. I guess this is a point of failure, improper management of team, I'll try to seek answers and improve myself here too.
