Cut the distractions, or so I yearn to do, and yet I fail miserably, only to get distracted by something else and well, repeat this again.\nI just finished my Cryptography test, absolutely nailed it, no regrets whatsoever. Finished the exam in half the time required. To be fair though, the questions weren\u0026rsquo;t inherently difficult to begin with, and I was in reality just solving based on pure muscle memory.\nAnyways, onto the topic at hand, distractions. See what I did there? I got distracted as I was writing this.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know why, but I am not able to focus for tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s test - Software Project Management. On the surface it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be that challenging but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to keep my hopes up high, it could end up being incredibly difficult as the questions are quite open ended.\nI am not sure what to do with this subject, I am probably going to get cooked not going to lie.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s incredible to me how the human brain just actively refuses to store information no matter how hard or relevant the information may be, probably an evolutionary mechanism to prevent storing unnecessary information.\nMy mind kept wandering, and it was quite the annoyance. Here I am, in two minds, study and adapt to tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s circumstances or get distracted and flunk and my brain is choosing the latter.\nEvolution really did us dirty. Atleast for me, in this specific situation and many such occasions which will inevitably arise in the future.\nI should figure something out\u0026hellip;\nWhat is the best way to streamline your thoughts into action, and towards the goal of the examination?\nBear with me for a second, I am thinking out loud.\nWell yesterday, it was the apparent scariness of the information that I was studying, and that kinda lit a fire up my ass.\nNot this time though, this strategy probably will not work because my brain is looking at the study materials and going - \u0026ldquo;Eh, seems easy enough. I should really start watching the next episode of Link Click.\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;This weekend right after my tests are over is gonna be inanse, I wonder what I should be doing?\u0026rdquo;\nI am not sure if this is a good strategy to follow.\nAlright, I gotta go figure something out or I am actually cooked. Peace.","href":"/posts/distraction/","kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":"2024-09-24T22:02:19+05:30","objectID":"89a2a632b4d511fd7852c5ec5a240417","publishDate":"2024-09-24T22:02:19+05:30","section":"posts","tags":["Life","Productivity","Work","Meaning","Education"],"title":"Distraction","type":"posts"},{"content":"Ah, yes, Management. The epitome of corporate circle-jerking and unnecessary corporate bureaucracy, nevertheless the most important part of any corporate structure or enterprise. And as a result of it\u0026rsquo;s significance, it taught in some form or sense in university.\nI just finished my Mid-Semester examination for the course - \u0026ldquo;Essentials of Management\u0026rdquo;. It was alright, except for one question that completely threw me on a curveball.\nThe question, as far as I can recall goes something like this:\nMr. X was involved in an organization that manufactures food products, he has a degree in the food manufacturing process and was dissatisfied in his current capcity. So he quit and established a new manufacturing unit for the same. He sets Mr. Y to set up the entire process and production system. Mr. X plans to handle the marketting part through his private outlets. Mr. Y also has to bring in certain sales expectations to Mr. X by the end of the quarter. The raw materials will be sourced by the organic farmers in a line of credit and will fund the first three months of the business. Mr. Y also plans to punish and penalise employees who don\u0026rsquo;t wear gloves during the production process. Identify the 4 types of plans that will be employed during this process.\nSeems easy enough, right? But I was completely wrong with my thought process and this is the core problem behind Management problems presented to you in examinations, atleas in India, where I am from.\nThe question asked for a list of plans that will be employed during the production process. The first thing that came to mind was a cost-benefit analysis. But then I thought that there might be some other kind of plan that would be more appropriate, so I started thinking about things like:\nFinancial Planning Sales Planning Strategy Planning So I figured that the question was looking for a list of plans, and I wrote down the 4 plans which I thought were applicable, after all they are asking the types of plans\nThis was my first and most detrimental mistake.\nOne look at my study material and you will find that apparently the types of plans are in fact:\nMission Vision Strategy Goals Objectives This is the type of absolute bullshit pulled by management, the lingo used doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense whatsoever but oh well. It\u0026rsquo;s incredible how they are using the words \u0026ldquo;plan\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;strategy\u0026rdquo; interchangeably. If the question was rather about strategy or drawing out / sketching out a strategic plan I would have written about what they required.\nAnyways, I should stop the rant. I\u0026rsquo;m going to start preparing for my cryptography test tomorrow, it\u0026rsquo;s fairly technical and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure they won\u0026rsquo;t drop in any tongue twisters like this test did.","href":"/posts/management/","kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":"2024-09-23T15:48:55+05:30","objectID":"277a2024429480d8a9ac7893b81f178e","publishDate":"2024-09-23T15:48:55+05:30","section":"posts","tags":["Management","University","Education","Examination"],"title":"Management","type":"posts"},{"content":"Becoming a polymath is easy, actually. For the longest time, I\u0026rsquo;ve caught myself wondering - \u0026ldquo;Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be possible to become specialised in any and every skill there is available since the advent of the search engine?\u0026rdquo; The search engine is the ultimate querying machine, with the expanse of knowledge covering some of the best minds in the world, all provided to you with the only pre-requisite of:\nHaving an internet connection A personal computer Yet, interestingly enough, I believe from my personal observations, that the exact opposite scenario is taking place, wherein we have people that have access to both the aforementioned prerequisite tech, but lack any and all ability to capture and transfer any information to any domain. Let me expand.\nThe world as we know it, at a very atomic level, functions transactionally. Any and all interaction is a transaction of some sort, so one would assume that with access to the internet, and search engines that deliver information at literally a millionth of a second, that humans would be able to equivalently acquire and disseminate new information and theories, i.e. a transaction.\nYeah this isn\u0026rsquo;t happening in my experience.\nWhat stopped researchers and scientists in the 20th century from advancing science? Acquisition of Information and Knowledge. Any and every theoretical or practical forthcomings presented by scientists requires a fundamental and depth-first understanding of several schema of knowledge tied together.\nRead that line again. And again, until you understand it.\nThe brain is essentially an ultra-threaded parallel processing computer that hosts a massive corpus of information. While it\u0026rsquo;s not clear how the brain stores memories, several leading theories suggest:\nEvolutionarily speaking, emotions and fundamental instincts drive memory (like hunter-gatherer instincts). Repetition, neurons that fire together, wire together. However all these theories fail to address one thing, any scientific advancement since the 20th century was not fueled by emotion or repetition, you weren\u0026rsquo;t being held at gunpoint to learn calculus out of the fear of losing your life or to repeatedly solve calculus problems to find solutions to determine the rate of radioactive decay.\nThey solved it by, well, asking how do I solve this problem?\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it, that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s lacking. Critical Thinking.\nThe ability to comprehend any and all information is, in my opinion, completely determined by whether you can ask the right questions. Here, right questions implies questions that allow you to comprehend. It\u0026rsquo;s recursive.\nThis is, inherently, a VERY complicated process. But, I believe this is the ideal way to perform scientific inquiry. Let\u0026rsquo;s divide and conquer the above graph to get a clear idea. The obvious part of course is, if it\u0026rsquo;s incomprehensible, as in, you can\u0026rsquo;t wrap your head around it, then it\u0026rsquo;s simply a problem of background knowledge. You lack the prerequisite formal knowledge to understand what it\u0026rsquo;s trying to suggest. You can fix this problem very quickly by simply asking yourself - \u0026ldquo;What don\u0026rsquo;t I understand? Why do I not understand it? What are the pieces that make up the idea and how do I understand them?\u0026rdquo;\nSeems simple enough right? Here\u0026rsquo;s the kicker, even if you understand the pieces, if you can\u0026rsquo;t understand it within the contextual setting, you won\u0026rsquo;t get anywhere. To question within context is the hardest process, gaining background knowledge is the easiest part.\nYou can do it though, and here comes two very important factors that influence the outcome of your current predicament.\nGrit Optimism I personally struggled with both, and I believe many people do, there\u0026rsquo;s a ceratin naivety required to understand the unknown, the belief that it is indeed comprehensible will completely eradicate any existing conflicting and confounding thought processes that perhaps, this endeavour was indeed futile and the result doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist.","href":"/posts/polymath/","kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":"2024-09-21T17:41:43+05:30","objectID":"68c185cd8faa82b141046c7608b801d1","publishDate":"2024-09-21T17:41:43+05:30","section":"posts","tags":[],"title":"Polymath","type":"posts"}]
