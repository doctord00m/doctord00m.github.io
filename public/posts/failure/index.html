        <p>In my limited experience on this planet, I have noticed that that people bullshit, a surprising amount. Now, I am going to go out on a limb and say that this is probably arises from a deep-rooted insecurity of their own competence and honestly, I don&rsquo;t blame them, if you can&rsquo;t find time to stop being a gobshite fool and fix yourself, you&rsquo;d just find alternate outlets to bullshit your way through everything.</p>
<p>The truth is however, you can fix this and it&rsquo;s all about how well you can tolerate these factors:</p>

<img src="/posts/image-10.png" alt="Tolerance to failure" class="center">


<p>And in my experience, <strong>people can NOT tolerate failure AT ALL</strong>.</p>
<p>Seneca, one of the greatest philosophers in history is known for saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No man is more unhappy than he who never faces adversity. For he who is not permitted to prove himself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the greatest pursuit in life, the thrill of the challenge, all human endeavours fundamentally boil down to this very fundamental fact, that ability to go in the face of adversity - <strong>FUCK YOU</strong> and face it regardless of whether you fail or not.</p>
<p>If this quality is not what distinguishes human beings from animals, then you&rsquo;re nothing BUT an animal.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I can understand, circumstances don&rsquo;t exactly suit the capabilites, it far superceeds it and obviously you fail, that&rsquo;s just a part of the process.</p>
<p>But to try -&gt; fail -&gt; Give up?</p>
<p>Bloody Ridiculous.</p>
<p>This is especially a problem with modern Software Engineering, or perhaps even Engineering in general. My peers are just absolutely horrendous at even trying, the instant something doesn&rsquo;t go their way, they fucking give up?</p>
<p>NO! Engineering doesn&rsquo;t work like that at all!</p>
<p>Before there were engineers, there were tinkerers, people dedicated to breaking shit apart, and observing the interactions between each individual part. What the fuck happend since then?</p>
<p>Just to reassure, this post is associated with my generation of Engineers, where we are outfitted with insane tools like - ChatGPT, Claude, Code Completion tools, IDEs.</p>
<p>Yet we lost the ability to trust our own fucking minds?</p>
<p>Sure, we fail a 1000x times but then if you give up, then you&rsquo;ve learnt jack fucking shit.</p>
<p>Those worthy of even being called Engineers are effectively late 20th century computer engineers, with a fundamental background in Electronics, Electrical sciences and Mathematics. They&rsquo;ve designed systems that are in-place till today.</p>
<p>But the reason they should be appreciated is because of the fact that they had no resouces besides Textbooks, Instruction Manuals and their Minds. Now imagine the amount of tolerance to failure they should have had to launch rockets to space with computers that we couldn&rsquo;t even dream of using in this modern day and age.</p>
<p>We are allowed to be lazy, but not complacent. Complacency destroys you. Be hungry.</p>
<p>Engineering is not a fucking step-by-step color-coded with a YouTube tutorial + Instruction Manual intended for ages 3+ Lego set.

<img src="/posts/image-11.png" alt="Lego" class="center">

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s repetitive, painful, irritating, frustrating work. But it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed this baby behaviour in my peers as well, where if there is a task assigned, and the step-by-step instructions don&rsquo;t, for all intents and purposes, CLEARLY legibly and straight-forwardly state how to do something, they give up. Just like that.</p>
<p>WTF??

<img src="/posts/image-12.png" alt="Baby engineer" class="center">

</p>
<p>I sincerely think, these type of people should be cut off access from the internet, given textbooks and a computer that barely works (in modern standards i.e. no bluetooth adapter, no RJ45 or ethernet ports, no Network Cards, nothing, barebones) and asked to learn and implement stuff as suggested by the textbook.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in doing this myself honestly, and if I do I will write a post about it here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of Time + Courage + Tolerance to go through that book and do something useful, but what you learn would be <strong>bloody significant</strong>.</p>
