<p>My typical learning process, before I started experimenting with myself could be broken down like so:</p>

<p>I think one very important thing that&rsquo;s not talked about frequently is that the best way to learn is to have failed, multiple times.</p>
<p><img alt="fail" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ede0UIyWoAIyKmH.jpg"></p>
<p>The above image is one of the coolest depictions of the concept I am talking about but basically the gist is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to learn anything, you must first experiment and try to answer the question for yourself, and you will fail, with which you can learn, re-adjust and try again, and again and again. Until you get it right.</p>]]></summary>

<p>The essence of learning anything new comes to <em>context</em>. Context is king.
Contextualizing a subject is the way you can relate the subject or information presented to you as a method of learning it deeply.</p>
<p>If you wanted to convert any highly boring and theoretical information into that which is easier for you to understand and process, and retain it over a long period of time, then the idea is to put it into different contexts.</p>]]></summary>

<p>Relevance is the most important factor in directing your learning.</p>

<p>This is a theory I have been cooking up for about the past three days. The entire premise is that without relevance, it&rsquo;s entirely impossible to learn effectively, let alone <em>learn</em>.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s define relevance within this context.</p>
<h2 id="relevance">Relevance</h2>
<p>Relevance is essentially the <em>metadata</em> attached to your present learning situation. Metadata describes how the data is structured, what it contains and how it&rsquo;s used. This is from the perspective of computing.</p>]]></summary>

<p>For the longest time, I&rsquo;ve caught myself wondering - &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t it be possible to become specialised in any and every skill there is available since the advent of the search engine?&rdquo;
The search engine is the ultimate querying machine, with the expanse of knowledge covering some of the best minds in  the world, all provided to you with the only pre-requisite of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having an internet connection</li>
<li>A personal computer</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet, interestingly enough, I believe from my personal observations, that the exact opposite scenario is taking place, wherein we have people that have access to both the aforementioned prerequisite tech, but lack any and all ability to capture and transfer any information to any domain.
