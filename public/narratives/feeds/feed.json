      "summary": " Editor\u0026rsquo;s note This version of Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass was adapted from The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass. The Guttenberg file does not tell us which witness was used in making their digital edition. The edition below is only a slightly modified version of the Guttenberg text, and therefore should not be taken too seriously as an edition. I use the text mostly to show a few affordances of using Ed for long form narrative. This page, for example, showcases a different sidebar than the rest of our sample site, with a table of content of the novel generated out of metadata in the source file. In addition, reading morsels of the novel on your different devices can give you a sense of the experience of reading prose using Ed, and shows you an example of the optional sidebar with a table of contents. A few other features of this page are described in more detail in the Documentation.",
