[{"content":"Becoming a polymath is easy, actually. For the longest time, I\u0026rsquo;ve caught myself wondering - \u0026ldquo;Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be possible to become specialised in any and every skill there is available since the advent of the search engine?\u0026rdquo; The search engine is the ultimate querying machine, with the expanse of knowledge covering some of the best minds in the world, all provided to you with the only pre-requisite of:\nHaving an internet connection A personal computer Yet, interestingly enough, I believe from my personal observations, that the exact opposite scenario is taking place, wherein we have people that have access to both the aforementioned prerequisite tech, but lack any and all ability to capture and transfer any information to any domain. Let me expand.\nThe world as we know it, at a very atomic level, functions transactionally. Any and all interaction is a transaction of some sort, so one would assume that with access to the internet, and search engines that deliver information at literally a millionth of a second, that humans would be able to equivalently acquire and disseminate new information and theories, i.e. a transaction.\nYeah this isn\u0026rsquo;t happening in my experience.\nWhat stopped researchers and scientists in the 20th century from advancing science? Acquisition of Information and Knowledge. Any and every theoretical or practical forthcomings presented by scientists requires a fundamental and depth-first understanding of several schema of knowledge tied together.\nRead that line again. And again, until you understand it.\nThe brain is essentially an ultra-threaded parallel processing computer that hosts a massive corpus of information. While it\u0026rsquo;s not clear how the brain stores memories, several leading theories suggest:\nEvolutionarily speaking, emotions and fundamental instincts drive memory (like hunter-gatherer instincts). Repetition, neurons that fire together, wire together. However all these theories fail to address one thing, any scientific advancement since the 20th century was not fueled by emotion or repetition, you weren\u0026rsquo;t being held at gunpoint to learn calculus out of the fear of losing your life or to repeatedly solve calculus problems to find solutions to determine the rate of radioactive decay.\nThey solved it by, well, asking how do I solve this problem?\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it, that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s lacking. Critical Thinking.\nThe ability to comprehend any and all information is, in my opinion, completely determined by whether you can ask the right questions. Here, right questions implies questions that allow you to comprehend. It\u0026rsquo;s recursive.\nThis is, inherently, a VERY complicated process. But, I believe this is the ideal way to perform scientific inquiry. Let\u0026rsquo;s divide and conquer the above graph to get a clear idea. The obvious part of course is, if it\u0026rsquo;s incomprehensible, as in, you can\u0026rsquo;t wrap your head around it, then it\u0026rsquo;s simply a problem of background knowledge. You lack the prerequisite formal knowledge to understand what it\u0026rsquo;s trying to suggest. You can fix this problem very quickly by simply asking yourself - \u0026ldquo;What don\u0026rsquo;t I understand? Why do I not understand it? What are the pieces that make up the idea and how do I understand them?\u0026rdquo;\nSeems simple enough right? Here\u0026rsquo;s the kicker, even if you understand the pieces, if you can\u0026rsquo;t understand it within the contextual setting, you won\u0026rsquo;t get anywhere. To question within context is the hardest process, gaining background knowledge is the easiest part.\nYou can do it though, and here comes two very important factors that influence the outcome of your current predicament.\nGrit Optimism I personally struggled with both, and I believe many people do, there\u0026rsquo;s a ceratin naivety required to understand the unknown, the belief that it is indeed comprehensible will completely eradicate any existing conflicting and confounding thought processes that perhaps, this endeavour was indeed futile and the result doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist.","href":"/posts/polymath/","kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":"2024-09-21T17:41:43+05:30","objectID":"68c185cd8faa82b141046c7608b801d1","publishDate":"2024-09-21T17:41:43+05:30","section":"posts","tags":[],"title":"Polymath","type":"posts"}]
